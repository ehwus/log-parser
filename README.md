# TODO - after finishing for the day on 22nd of June

- Parse each line of the file in the LogParser (find a way to test this ideally as currently we're actually using the file system even in tests)
- Connect the LogSorter to LogParser, use mocking to fully test implementation
- Finish parser.rb to use ARGV to call the function
- Integration test to make sure everything is playing nicely together (use webserver.log for this maybe?)
